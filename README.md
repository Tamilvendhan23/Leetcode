## Repository structure

Each problem is organized in its own folder, typically named with the problem number and title (for example `0008-string-to-integer-atoi/`). Solutions are written primarily in Java and Python. Use the folder names to quickly locate solutions for specific problems.

Example layout:

```
0008-string-to-integer-atoi/
0009-palindrome-number/
...
3169-count-days-without-meetings/
README.md
```
